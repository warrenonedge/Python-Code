Say you're dealing with data that has a lot of repeated characters in it. You'd like to take advantage of that to compress the data. In particular, you are given the following run-length encoding scheme: An encoded string is normally passed through verbatim. However, if there is a decimal number followed by the character 'x', then the character after the x will be repeated that many times."
For example: "abc11xkd55s" -> "abckkkkkkkkkkkd55s"

abc11xk5x1584xablcjd

psudo:
	loop over string to find a number
	if number is found:
		read number until x
		if other letter if found then skip number.
		else:
			append number * next char to result


	
abc11d2xj -> abc11djj 
abc2xx3dd -> abcxx3dd
abc3xxxds -> acbxxxxds   
xxxxxx    -> xxxxxx
abc1000000000000000000000000000000000x4

def repeater(decode):
	result = “”
	number = “”
	i = 0
	while i < len(decode):
	#for i, l in enumerate(decode):
		if decode[i].isDigit():
			number += decode[i]
		elif decode[i] == ‘x’ and number != “”:
			result += int(number)*decode[i+1]
			number = “”
			i++
		else:
			result += number + decode[i]
			number = “”
		i++
	print(result)		

l = “d”
number = “”
result = “abcxx3dd”
